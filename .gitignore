# Optional: If you don't want to commit generated images

# *.jpeg
# If you *do* want to commit a few example output images,
# you can comment out the lines above or list specific images to ignore.
# For now, let's assume we might want to add a couple of screenshots later,
# so we won't ignore all PNGs yet.
# If you generate many test images, you might want to uncomment *.png
# or delete them before committing.
